# CS Scripting: Internal JavaScript

This repository explores the “classic” method of embedding JavaScript directly into HTML — a nostalgic throwback to simpler, messier times.

---

## 📄 Overview

- All scripts are written inline within the HTML file, because separating files is for people with time and structure.
- No CSS was harmed (or used) in the making of this project.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Follow instructions from the book and sir without asking why  
- Put everything in one file to keep things “simple”  
- Demonstrate that JavaScript can live inside HTML — whether it should is another matter  

---

## 💻 How to Use

- Open `index.html` in any browser that hasn’t retired.  
- Or click the Netlify version if you're feeling fancy:

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- HTML  
- JavaScript (internal `<script>` tag)

---

**🛠️ Note:**  
One of the book’s examples had a missing `>` and an incomplete `onclick`.  
It’s been fixed to keep the button working as intended.
