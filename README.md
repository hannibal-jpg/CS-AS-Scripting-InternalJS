# CS Scripting: Internal JavaScript

This repository explores the “classic” method of embedding JavaScript directly into HTML — a nostalgic throwback to simpler, messier times.

## Overview

All scripts are written inline within the HTML file, because separating files is for people with time and structure.  
No CSS was harmed (or used) in the making of this project.

**## 🛠️ Note:**
One of the book’s examples had a missing > and an incomplete onclick.
It’s been fixed to keep the button working as intended.

## Project Goals

- Follow instructions from the book and sir without asking why  
- Put everything in one file to keep things “simple”  
- Demonstrate that JavaScript *can* live inside HTML — whether it should is another matter

## How to Use

Open `index.html` in any browser that hasn’t retired.  
Or click the Netlify version if you're feeling fancy:

- JavaScript (internal script tag)

## Licensing

You probably don’t want to reuse this, but if you must, go ahead.  
Just don’t say you wrote it yourself — unless you also had to follow the same book.
